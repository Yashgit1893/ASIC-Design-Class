<summary>LAB 3: Compiling the sum from 1 to n(value of n in the code sum1ton.c of Lab 1 is changed to 100) C program using Spike simulator and debug the code. </summary>

compiling the `sum1ton.c` using the RISC-V compiler using the Ofast command :

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```

<p align="left">
 <img width="750" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a67b6868-c6b6-4182-8bc4-45d7a476a575">
</p>

The above image shows the output using both `./a.out ` and `spike pk sum1ton.o`. Both of them have same output for sum from 1 to 100.

### Debug 

Debug the code using spike command :

```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```

command for spike debugger to run till instruction 100b0
```bash
until pc 0 100b0
```
to check the value at the register a2
```bash
reg 0 a2
```
<p align="left">
  <img width="750" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4afaa25c-43f5-4e74-9997-76b20d08897c">
</p>

The above image displays how the value of a2 register changes while manual debugging.
The instruction `lui a2, 0x1` instruction changes the a2 register's value from 0x0000000000000000 to 0x0000000000001000.
The instruction `lui a0, 0x21` shows the a0 register value 0x0000000000021000.




Futher steps shows the vlaue at register sp. we again run the instructions from 0 to 100b8.

```bash
until pc 0 100b8
```

check the value at the register sp
```bash
reg 0 sp
```

The below image shows the manual debug.
`addi sp, sp, -16` instruction decrements the stack pointer (sp) by 16, The value of sp register was 0x0000003ffffffb50, and is now updated to 0x0000003ffffffb40

Note :

1. lui stands for Load Upper Immediate, operates on the higher 16 bits and addi (Add Immediate) performs addition between the immediate value and the contents of the source register, then places the result into the destination register.

# RISC-V instructions


RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer - V) is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established principles of RISC. The RISC-V ISA has a small number of instruction formats, making it relatively simple to understand and implement. The primary instruction formats in RISC-V are **R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type,** and **J-type**. Each format is designed for different types of operations and encodes different information in the instruction's 32 bits.

Here’s the revised version with the instruction formats listed in the requested format:

### 1. **R-type (Register)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Used for arithmetic and logical operations involving two source registers and one destination register.
  2. Allows complex operations like addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations.
  3. Commonly used in ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operations.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code that specifies the instruction.
  - **rd (5 bits):** Destination register.
  - **funct3 (3 bits):** Function modifier for opcode; helps determine the specific operation.
  - **rs1 (5 bits):** First source register.
  - **rs2 (5 bits):** Second source register.
  - **funct7 (7 bits):** Additional function modifier; often used to extend the opcode.

### 2. **I-type (Immediate)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Handles operations with one source register and an immediate (constant) value.
  2. Used in load instructions, arithmetic with immediate values, and system calls.
  3. Simplifies operations that require a constant operand.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code.
  - **rd (5 bits):** Destination register.
  - **funct3 (3 bits):** Function modifier.
  - **rs1 (5 bits):** Source register.
  - **imm[11:0] (12 bits):** Immediate value.

### 3. **S-type (Store)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Facilitates storing data from a register into memory.
  2. Combines a base address (from a register) with an offset to calculate the memory address.
  3. Often used in conjunction with load instructions to manage memory.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code.
  - **imm[11:5] (7 bits):** Upper bits of the immediate value.
  - **rs2 (5 bits):** Source register (data to store).
  - **rs1 (5 bits):** Base address register.
  - **funct3 (3 bits):** Function modifier.
  - **imm[4:0] (5 bits):** Lower bits of the immediate value.

### 4. **B-type (Branch)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Used for conditional branching based on comparisons between two registers.
  2. Helps in implementing control flow constructs like loops and conditional statements.
  3. Modifies the program counter based on a branch condition.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code.
  - **imm[12] (1 bit):** Immediate value (bit 12).
  - **imm[10:5] (6 bits):** Immediate value (bits 10-5).
  - **rs2 (5 bits):** Second source register.
  - **rs1 (5 bits):** First source register.
  - **funct3 (3 bits):** Function modifier.
  - **imm[4:1] (4 bits):** Immediate value (bits 4-1).
  - **imm[11] (1 bit):** Immediate value (bit 11).

### 5. **U-type (Upper Immediate)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Used for loading a 20-bit immediate value into a register.
  2. Commonly used for creating large constants or setting up addresses.
  3. Essential for address calculation in conjunction with other instructions.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code.
  - **rd (5 bits):** Destination register.
  - **imm[31:12] (20 bits):** Upper 20 bits of the immediate value.

### 6. **J-type (Jump)**
- **Explanation:**
  1. Directly modifies the program counter to jump to a new instruction address.
  2. Includes instructions like `jal` for jumping and linking return addresses.
  3. Useful for function calls and handling program control flow.

- **Instruction format:**
  - **opcode (7 bits):** Operation code.
  - **rd (5 bits):** Destination register.
  - **imm[20] (1 bit):** Immediate value (bit 20).
  - **imm[10:1] (10 bits):** Immediate value (bits 10-1).
  - **imm[11] (1 bit):** Immediate value (bit 11).
  - **imm[19:12] (8 bits):** Immediate value (bits 19-12).

## Explanation of the subfields :

Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of each field:

### Immediate (`imm`)
A variable-length field embedded in instructions, representing a constant value. It's used directly as an operand or offset in various operations, such as arithmetic, memory access, and branching. The size and location differ across instruction formats, with some requiring sign extension.

### `funct7`
A 7-bit function code that specifies the operation variant within R-type instructions. It works with `opcode` and `funct3` to differentiate operations sharing the same basic function, like distinguishing between `add` and `sub`.

### `funct3`
A 3-bit field that further refines the operation specified by the `opcode`. It is used across multiple instruction formats (R-type, I-type, etc.) to indicate specific operations or conditions, such as arithmetic functions, memory operations, or branch types.

### `opcode`
A 7-bit field that identifies the general operation category (e.g., arithmetic, load/store, branch). It forms the basis for instruction decoding and works with `funct3` and `funct7` to determine the specific operation.

### Register Specifiers (`rs1`, `rs2`, `rd`)
- **`rs1` and `rs2`:** Source registers providing operands for an operation.
- **`rd`:** The destination register where the result is stored. These fields are central to operations across RISC-V formats, ensuring consistent and efficient register access.
